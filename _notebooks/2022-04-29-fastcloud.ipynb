    "## The Problem\n",
    "On ground observations are a key part to weather forecasting. Most observations are taken by autonomous systems but there are still a few routine observations that are done manually by a human. One of these is cloud type classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This manual observation is currently done is at major airports around Australia. At these airports one or more highly knowledgeable and accredited aerodrome weather observers is stationed to take manual weather observations on a fixed schedule throughout each day. But, having such specialized observers at all airports all of the time is not cost effective or realistically feasible, especially for remote locations (e.g. uninhabited islands or infrequently used aerodromes). Therefore many of these remote or small areas miss out on observations and perhaps receive lower quality situational awareness and forecasts as a result."

    "## The Solution\n",
    "Using deep learning and image classification techniques to classifying cloud types from photographs seemed to me a very plausible solution to this problem. Therefore, after the Fastai course v5 lecture 1 I thought I'd try to do exactly that using a visual learner example Jeremy provided as my starting point.\n",

    "While this is very basic demo and only about 70% accurate, it shows great potential for automating some of the cloud type observing in remote regions of Australia where there is currnetly limited or no human observer coverage, and therefore this work might benifit from future work.\n",
