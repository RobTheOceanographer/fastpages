    "[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) recently released version 2 of their popular [nbdev toolkit](https://nbdev.fast.ai/). nbdev is a set of tools that enable you to write, test, document, and distribute software packages and technical articles all in one place - [the jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Version two, like version one, is designed with integration into the [github.com](github.com) ecosystem therefore making it a little more difficult to use in other similar ecosystems. Where I work we run an internal [gitlab.com](gitlab.com) system and are unable to use the github features of nbdev. So, for the last year or so I have been using a modified nbdev v1 system that i hacked together to work on the gitlab ecosystem and now with the recent update to version 2 I have set out to do the same again. This time i thought i'd share what i did and learnt along the way."

    "[gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html) is configured in a similar way to github actions in that there is a config file that lives in your repo to tell the [runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) what to do and when to do it. The config file detail what os/environment to use to run your code in. In the official nbdev case they use the latest build of [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and in my case I use a [continuumio/miniconda3 build](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/miniconda3) as my base. nbdev use this image base to install the latest versions of everything on the fly during every actions run but as i have a shared and quite slow runner at work I tend to use a pre-build container with the latest nbdev and quarto already installed and ready to go.
