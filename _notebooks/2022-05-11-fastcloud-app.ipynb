Data cleaning turned out to be a big part of making FastClouds perform better as the images i scraped from [duckduckgo](http://.duckduckgo.com) for clouds turned out to be quite messy and unreliably classified... unsurprising really. Once i'd cleaned up my image data set my model went from ~75% accurate to ~81% accurate.\n"

    "Data augmentation using the fastai DataBlock was super simple to implement. I just added the `batch_tfms=aug_transforms()` line to my DataBlock definition and fastai took care of the rest for me. Data augmentation did add a bit of skill to the model - we went from ~81% to ~85% - but i suspect that this is because the input images are already quite varied and so augmentation didn't add that much more information for the model to learn. This is a batch of augmented images and they look very similar to the original images:"
