Rob Johnson is a jack-of-all trades, Doctor of Philosophy, data scientist, recovering oceanographer, doer and oddball. Described by a colleague as "â€¦good at turning data into insights. Rob  communicates complex matters effectively and is comfortable saying 'I don't know, but I know how to find out'", he also happens to be genuinely excited by scientific challenges and his passion motivates others to do their best. With a string of successful science projects under his belt, Rob has become known for his warm and engaging personality, authentic insights, and wealth of knowledge and experience that he applies to new challenges. Though all of  this he has developed a great "BS" detector, which allows him to make progress where others get stuck.

Rob currently works on aviation related data science problems: for example building state of the art nowcasts for lightning and thunderstorms, automating business process and optimising decision making for Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFS), and machine learning based weather nowcasting. Rob has worked on broad range of projects from measuring Antarctic Phytoplankton photo-physiology, algorithm development for space based remote sensing, weather modelling using machine learning and AI, to High Performance Computing system administration and data engineering for earth system modelling.

Being interested in all fields of science, and instantly memorable, speaks volumes about how Rob goes about life and represents himself to the world, believing wholeheartedly that science can be made useful through state of the art science being combined with advanced software engineering.

Rob lives in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.
