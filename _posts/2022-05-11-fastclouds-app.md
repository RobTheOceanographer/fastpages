<p>I am currently a student in the <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">fast.ai practical deep learnign for coders v5</a> class and after the first week I built a cloud type classifier called <strong><em>FastClouds</em></strong> - which you can read about <a href="https://www.robtheoceanographer.com/fastclouds.html">here</a></p>
<p>After the second and third lesson I have implemented some of the things <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward">Jeremy</a> discussed and worked through and that is what I have to show you in this post.</p>

<p>In lesson 2 of <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">https://course.fast.ai/</a> v5 data cleaning and data augmentation was discussed. Data cleaning turned out to be a big part of making FastClouds perform better as the images i scraped from <a href="http://.duckduckgo.com">duckduckgo</a> for clouds turned out to be quite messy and unreliably classified... unsurprising really. Once i'd cleaned up my image data set my model went from ~75% accurate to ~81% accurate.</p>

<p>Data augmentation using the fastai DataBlock was super simple to implement. I just added the <code>batch_tfms=aug_transforms()</code> line to my DataBlock definition and fastai took care of the rest for me. Data augmentation did add a bit of skill to the model - we went from ~81% to ~85% - but i suspect that this is because the input images are already quite varied and so augmentation didn't add that much more information for the model to learn. This is a batch of augmented images and they look very similar to the original images:</p>

<p>In the end we have a model that is about ~85% accurate using pretty much out of the box fastai methods and using a very small dataset - the final version only used 50 images from each category. As far as I know there is no other model out there that can classify clouds from images with this accuracy.</p>
<p>For reference, the notebook used is here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/robtheoceanographer/fastclouds">Kaggle Notebook</a> and here <a href="https://github.com/RobTheOceanographer/FastClouds">GitHub Repo</a></p>

<p>Now that we have a model i'd like to be able to make it 'operational' and available for people to use. The Transition to Operations (TROPS) using <a href="https://huggingface.co">huggingface</a> and <a href="https://www.gradio.app/">gradio</a> was discussed in lesson 2 and that is what i have used here to deploy the FastCloud model.</p>
<p>The app version looks like this:</p>

<p>and you can go to this URL to play with it.</p>

<p>I'd love it is you send me screenshots of the clouds you classify with this. Thanks for reading.</p>
