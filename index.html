Hi, I'm Rob. I'm a scientist, agilist, coach, and educator.

The first part of my career was as an oceanographer but I have spent the last decade leading people and making science useful. I believe that science is capable of incredible things... if it is made useful to people and communities. I am at my best when leading people to bring cutting edge science to bear on useful and practical problems for our community.
