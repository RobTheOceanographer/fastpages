Hi, I'm Rob. I'm a Data Scientist.

I've spent the last decade working on projects where Oceanography and Data Science collide. For the last little while my work has been focused on the development, optimisation, and use of bespoke earth system modelling and satelite remote sensing methods for the Ocean.
There are two core elements at the centre of my work. Firstly, a drive to do data intensive science and to make research results practical through progressing the state of the art of scientific software engineering & data science, and through the operationalisation of emerging research into useful and reusable products or services. Secondly, the ocean and the microscopic life that lives in the sea.
